/**
 * Merge K Sorted Lists
 * Coding and Algorithms
 *
 * 1) Implement an algorithm that merges K sorted lists in a single sorted list. *Example: Input k=3, n=4 list1 = 1->3->5->7->NULL list2 = 2->4->6->8->NULL list3 = 0->9-10-11->NULL
 *
 * Output: 0->1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9->10->11->NULL Merged Lists in a sorted order where every element is greater than the previous element.
 *
 * The implementation must follow this interface:
 *
 *         package coding.exercise;
 *
 *         import java.util.List;
 *
 *         public interface Merger {
 *             List<Integer> merge(List<List<Integer>> lists);
 *         }
 *
 * 2) Which is the execution order for the proposed solution?
 *
 * 3) Which test would you add to ensure the correctness of the proposed algorithm?. Which scenarios do you think are relevant to be tested?
 *
 * Refactoring:
 *
 * 1) How would you adapt the code if the sorting criteria can change? Also consider that the Merger interface can't be changed.
 *
 * 2) What about if the lists can have other types of data (e.g. String)
